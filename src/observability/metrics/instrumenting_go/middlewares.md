# API Framework Instrumentation Middleware

In this section we'll cover instrumenting RESTful HTTP APIs built on three common Golang frameworks: [Gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin), [Echo](https://github.com/labstack/echo), and [Beego](https://github.com/beego/beego).

For consistency, we'll adapt a similar Users API from the previous section to serve as our example service. For a description of the API we're building, see [Defining an Example Service](./simple_service.md#defining-an-example-service).
