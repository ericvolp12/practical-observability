# Observability

> In control theory, observability (o11y) is defined as a measure of how well internal states of a system can be inferred from knowledge of its external outputs.[^1]

Observability lives both at the heart of Planet's mission to make global change visible, accessible and actionable, and at the heart of a solid operations strategy. 

> For software systems, observability is a measure of how well you can understand and explain any state your system can get into.[^1]

Observability has three commonly agreed-upon pillars and a fourth more emergent pillar: Metrics, Logging, Tracing, and Profiling.

This knowledgebase aims to provide a primer on each of these pillars of o11y through the lens of Planet's observability tooling vendor, [Grafana](https://grafana.com/).

Through the sections of this chapter, you will be able to learn the fundamentals of Metrics, Logging, Tracing, and Profiling, see code samples in Planet's standard coding languages (Python and Golang), and develop the skills required to create high signal, insightful dashboards to increase visibility and reduce Mean Time to Resolution for production incidents.
